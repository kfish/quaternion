# Quaternions

_Impossible transforms are inexpressible_

Can express rotations, but not shearing, scaling or translations

Translations are trivial

Shearing and scaling don't happen in the real world

Scaling is trivial

So, a combination of translation and orientation (via quaternions)
is everything you need for world transforms.


Also, quaternions are faster than matrices due to 4 components not 9.
